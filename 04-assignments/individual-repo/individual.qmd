title: "Individual Assignment 1 · Your First GitHub Repository"
description: |
  Create a brand-new public repository, add at least one file,
  and submit a shareable link so the TA can clone, open, and grade it.
format: html
---

> **Why this matters**  
> If you can stand up a clean, clonable repo by yourself, everything else in DS 101 will feel easy.

## Objectives

By completing this assignment you will:

1. Practice the full **Change → Stage → Commit → Push** cycle on your own.  
2. Confirm your Git installation, global config, and PAT all work.  
3. Produce a URL that anyone (including future employers) can visit and clone.

---

## Task Checklist

1. **Sign in to GitHub** with the personal account you created in Part 2.  
2. **Create a new repository** named exactly  
   ```
   ds101-first-repo
   ```  
   * Settings: Public ✓   “Add a README” ✓   License — none required.  
3. **Clone** the repo to your computer (GitHub Desktop, RStudio, or terminal).  
4. **Add a file** of your choice, e.g.  
   * `hello.md` with a two-sentence greeting **or**  
   * `code.R` that prints `"Hello DS 101!"`.  
5. **Commit** your changes with a meaningful message (e.g., `Add hello.md`).  
6. **Push** to GitHub.  
7. **Copy the HTTPS link** (you’ll submit this).  
   Example:  
   ```
   https://github.com/jane-doe/ds101-first-repo
   ```

## What to Submit

* **One URL** to your repo, pasted into the Canvas → Assignment submission box.  
  *No ZIP uploads, no screenshots.*

## Grading Rubric (40 pts)

| Criterion | Excellent (Full pts) | Points |
|-----------|---------------------|-------:|
| **Link Provided** | Valid HTTPS URL pasted; opens in TA’s browser. | 5 |
| **Repository Public** | TA can view without extra permissions. | 5 |
| **Clonable** | `git clone <URL>` works without errors. | 15 |
| **File Present** | At least one non-empty file pushed (README counts if edited). | 10 |
| **Commit Message** | Descriptive (not “update” or “asgn1”). | 5 |

> **Total: 40 points**  
> A repo that fails to clone automatically earns **0** on “Clonable” plus deductions on any other missing criteria.

## Tips & Troubleshooting

* **Push vs. Commit** — Commit saves *locally*; Push uploads. Forgetting to push is the #1 mistake.
* **Empty repos** won’t clone via HTTPS; always click **“Add a README”** when creating.
* PAT glitches? Run  
  ```bash
  git config --global credential.helper store
  ```  
  then push again and paste your token once.
* Still stuck? Post a screenshot in **#git-help**.
