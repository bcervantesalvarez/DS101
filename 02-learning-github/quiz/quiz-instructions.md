## üìã Git & GitHub Pre-Reading Quiz ‚Äî Instructions

**Why this quiz?**  
Before you install software or write a single command, we want to be sure you‚Äôve absorbed the big-picture ideas from the two required readings (and the optional third, if you chose to read it). Scoring at least **8 / 10** confirms you understand:

1. What GitHub is and the basic objects it tracks (repo, branch, commit, pull request).  
2. Core terminal skills (`cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, etc.) you‚Äôll use in the hands-on guide.  
3. Essential Git setup steps: install, configure identity, create a PAT, clone, add, commit, push, pull.
