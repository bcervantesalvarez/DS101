> A public portfolio is like your resume's cooler sibling. It lets employers,
> professors, and peers *see* what you’ve built. And Quarto makes it easier than ever.

## Goals

If you complete this assignment, you’ll:

1. Create a live website using Quarto that showcases who you are.  
2. Deploy your portfolio to **GitHub Pages** with just a few clicks.  
3. Customize it with sections like **About Me**, **Projects**, **Blog**, and **Resources**.  
4. Learn how static site generators like Quarto integrate seamlessly with GitHub.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Build

A multi-page site built from scratch (using `.qmd` files) with the following:

| Page | Required? | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `index.qmd` | ✅ | Your homepage – introduce yourself! |
| `about.qmd` | ✅ | A deeper bio – education, interests, goals. |
| `projects.qmd` | ✅ | Describe 1–2 things you’ve made or learned. |
| `blog.qmd` | ❌ | Optional journal or reflection space. |
| `resources.qmd` | ❌ | Optional list of useful links (books, sites, tools). |
