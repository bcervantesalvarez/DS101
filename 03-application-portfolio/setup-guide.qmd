## üß≠ What‚Äôs This For?

By now, you‚Äôve made a GitHub account, installed Git, and learned the basics.  
Now it‚Äôs time to **link GitHub to your computer** so you can build and push your portfolio.

You have two great tools to choose from:

- **RStudio** ‚Äî great for R and Quarto work  
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** ‚Äî flexible and great for coding in any language

You‚Äôll only need to follow one path, but we‚Äôll show both.

---

## üõ† Option A ‚Äî RStudio + GitHub (Recommended for R users)

> This path is ideal if you're planning to build your portfolio with R, RMarkdown, or Quarto.

### Step 1: Open RStudio

1. Click on the RStudio icon (blue circle with an R).  
2. If you‚Äôve never opened it before, give it a second to load.

### Step 2: Check Git Setup

1. Click **Tools ‚ûú Global Options ‚ûú Git/SVN** (or **Version Control** in newer versions).
2. If Git is installed, you‚Äôll see something like:
   ```
   Git executable: /usr/bin/git  ‚úÖ
   ```
   If it says **not found**, go back to the Install Git section.

### Step 3: Set Your Name & Email

Still in RStudio:
- Enter your **GitHub username** as your name (e.g., `brian-data`)
- Enter your **GitHub email** (the one you used when signing up)

Click **Apply** and then **OK**.

### Step 4: Create a New Project from GitHub

1. Click **File ‚ûú New Project ‚ûú Version Control ‚ûú Git**  
2. Paste your GitHub repo‚Äôs HTTPS link (e.g., `https://github.com/yourname/portfolio`)
3. Choose a folder on your computer
4. Click **Create Project**

üéâ You just cloned your repo! You‚Äôll see all your files in the top-right pane.

## üß∞ Option B ‚Äî VS Code + GitHub

> This path is great if you're working with Python, HTML, or just like a flexible editor.

### Step 1: Open VS Code

- Look for the blue square icon with a white angle-bracket `</>`

### Step 2: Install GitHub Extension

1. On the left bar, click the **Extensions icon** (looks like 4 boxes)
2. Search for **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues**  
3. Click **Install**

### Step 3: Sign Into GitHub

1. Click the **Accounts icon** in the bottom-left corner (circle with your initials or icon)
2. Choose **Sign in with GitHub**  
3. Follow the popup instructions (it‚Äôll open in your browser)

VS Code is now linked to your GitHub account!

### Step 4: Clone a Repo

1. Press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> (or <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> on Mac)
2. Type: `Git: Clone`
3. Paste your repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourname/portfolio`)
4. Choose where to save it

VS Code will ask if you want to open it now‚Äîsay yes!

## üß™ Checkpoint: Make a Small Change

No matter which tool you used:

1. Open `README.md` or `index.qmd`
2. Add a sentence like:
   ```
   Hello from my new portfolio!
   ```
3. Save the file.
4. In RStudio: go to the **Git tab**, check the file, **Commit** and then **Push**  
5. In VS Code: click the **Source Control icon**, write a message, click the ‚úîÔ∏è checkmark, then click **Push**
